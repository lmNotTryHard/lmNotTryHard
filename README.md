## 📜 About Me
Hello, I'm Erdaulet, and I love programming. My passion for this field began in the 9th grade when I first delved into the world of coding. Since then, I have actively participated in school programming projects and computer science Olympiads. I constantly improve my skills by learning new programming languages and frameworks. My dream is to pursue a career in the IT industry.

👨‍💻 Now I’m currently learning: **Swift**
